I"W<p><a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020">NeurIPS 2020</a> is the biggest conference on machine learning, with tons of content on differential privacy in many different forms.
We were able to find two workshops, a competition, and 31 papers. 
This was just going off the preliminary <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/AcceptedPapersInitial">accepted papers list</a>, so it’s possible that we might have missed some papers on differential privacy – please let us know!
We will update this post later, once all the conference material (papers and videos) are publicly available.</p>
