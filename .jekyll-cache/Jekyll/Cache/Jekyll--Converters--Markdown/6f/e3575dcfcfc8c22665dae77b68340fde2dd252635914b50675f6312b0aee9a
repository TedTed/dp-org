I"B<p><a href="https://www.learningtheory.org/colt2020/">COLT 2020</a> was held online in July, and featured nine papers on differential privacy, as well as a keynote talk by Salil Vadhan.
While differential privacy has always had a home in the COLT community, it seems like this year was truly exceptional in terms of the number of results.
We link all the content below, including pointers to the papers, videos on Youtube, and the page on the conference website.
