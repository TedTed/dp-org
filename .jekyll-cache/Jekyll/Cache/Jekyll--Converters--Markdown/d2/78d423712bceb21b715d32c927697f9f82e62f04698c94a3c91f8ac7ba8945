I"s<p>On April 28, 2021, the US Census Bureau <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/planning-management/process/disclosure-avoidance/2020-das-updates.html">released</a> a new demonstration of its differentially private Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) for the 2020 US Census. The public were given a month to submit feedback before the system is finalized.
This demonstration data and the feedback has generated a lot of discussion, including media coverage on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/19/993247101/for-the-u-s-census-keeping-your-data-anonymous-and-useful-is-a-tricky-balance">National Public Radio</a>, in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/2020-census-differential-privacy-ipums/2021/06/01/6c94b46e-c30d-11eb-93f5-ee9558eecf4b_story.html">the Washington Post</a>, and via <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-census-2020-technology-e701e313e841674be6396321343b7e49">the Associated Press</a>. The DAS is also the subject of an <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/59728874/state-v-united-states-department-of-commerce/">ongoing lawsuit</a>.</p>
