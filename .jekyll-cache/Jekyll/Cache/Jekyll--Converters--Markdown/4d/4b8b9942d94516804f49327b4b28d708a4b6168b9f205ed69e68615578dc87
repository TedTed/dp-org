I"(<p><a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2021">ICML 2021</a>, one of the biggest conferences in machine learning, naturally has a ton of interesting sounding papers on the topic of differential privacy.
We went through this yearâ€™s <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2021/AcceptedPapersInitial">accepted papers</a> and aggregated all the relevant papers we could find.
In addition, this year features three workshops on the topic of privacy, as well as a tutorial.
As always, please inform us if we overlooked any papers on differential privacy.</p>
