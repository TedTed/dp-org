I"²<p><strong>Background:</strong> Perhaps the best-studied problem in differential privacy is answering multiple counting queries.
The standard approach is to add independent, appropriately-calibrated (Laplace or Gaussian) noise to each query result and apply a composition theorem.
To bound the maximum error over the query answers, one takes a union bound over the independent noise samples.
However, this is <em>not</em> optimal.
The problem is to identify the optimal method (up to constant factors).</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Is there a randomized algorithm \(M : \{0,1\}^{n \times k} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k\) that is differentially private<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and satisfies
\[
\forall x \in \{0, 1\}^{n \times k} \quad \mathbb{E}\left[ \left\|M(x) - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right\|_\infty \right] \leq c \sqrt{k}
\]
for some constant \( c &gt; 0\) depending only on the privacy parameters?<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Adding independent Gaussian noise to each coordinate/query yields \(c \sqrt{k \log k}\) in place of \(c \sqrt{k}\) above. 
Steinke and Ullman [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06095">SU17</a>] showed that the union bound can <em>almost</em> be avoided and obtained \(c \sqrt{k \log \log k}\) using correlated noise.
The algorithm is nonetheless based on independent Gaussian noise, with the added step of using the exponential mechanism to identify high-error answers and correct them.</p>

<p>Note that a \(\Omega(\sqrt{k})\) lower bound is known [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3158">BUV18</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06095">SU17</a>]. By [<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~bhaskara/files/privacy.pdf">BDKT12</a>] it suffices to consider mechanisms \(M\) that add <em>instance-independent noise</em>. That is, \(M(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + Z\) where \(Z\) is some fixed noise distribution over \(\mathbb{R}^k\) that is independent of \(x\).</p>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> For a positive solution, an all-you-can-eat sushi dinner at a sushi restaurant of your choice.
If the solution is an efficiently-sampleable distribution with a closed-form density, alcohol will be included.
For a negative solution, alcohol only.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

A very recent work by Ganesh and Zhao [<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~arunganesh/papers/generalizedgaussians.pdf">GZ20</a>] improves the best upper bound from \(c\sqrt{k \log \log k}\) to \(c\sqrt{k \log \log \log k}\).</p>
