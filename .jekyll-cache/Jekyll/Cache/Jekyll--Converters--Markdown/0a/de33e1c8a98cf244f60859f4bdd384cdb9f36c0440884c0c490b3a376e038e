I"Ñ<p>Work on differential privacy spans a number of different research communities, including theoretical computer science, machine learning, statistics, security, law, databases, cryptography, programming languages, social sciences, and more.
Each of these communities may choose to publish their work in their own communityâ€™s venues, which could result in small groups of differential privacy researchers becoming isolated.
To alleviate these issues, we have the Workshop on the <a href="https://tpdp.journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/">Theory and Practice of Differential Privacy</a> (TPDP), which is intended to bring these subcommunities together under one roof (well, a virtual one at least for 2020 and 2021).</p>
