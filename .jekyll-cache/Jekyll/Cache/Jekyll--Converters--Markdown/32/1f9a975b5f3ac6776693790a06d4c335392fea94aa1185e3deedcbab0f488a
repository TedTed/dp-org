I"f<p>Welcome to ALT Highlights, a series of blog posts spotlighting various happenings at the recent conference <a href="http://algorithmiclearningtheory.org/alt2021/">ALT 2021</a>, including plenary talks, tutorials, trends in learning theory, and more! 
To reach a broad audience, the series will be disseminated as guest posts on different blogs in machine learning and theoretical computer science. 
Given the topic of this post, we felt <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/">DifferentialPrivacy.org</a> was a great fit.
This initiative is organized by the <a href="https://www.let-all.com/">Learning Theory Alliance</a>, and overseen by <a href="http://www.gautamkamath.com/">Gautam Kamath</a>. 
All posts in ALT Highlights are indexed on the official <a href="https://www.let-all.com/blog/2021/04/20/alt-highlights-2021/">Learning Theory Alliance blog</a>.</p>
