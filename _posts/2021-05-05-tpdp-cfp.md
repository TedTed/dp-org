Work on differential privacy spans a number of different research communities, including theoretical computer science, machine learning, statistics, security, law, databases, cryptography, programming languages, social sciences, and more.
Each of these communities may choose to publish their work in their own community's venues, which could result in small groups of differential privacy researchers becoming isolated.
To alleviate these issues, we have the Workshop on the [Theory and Practice of Differential Privacy](https://tpdp.journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/) (TPDP), which is intended to bring these subcommunities together under one roof (well, a virtual one at least for 2020 and 2021).

We have just posted the [Call for Papers](https://tpdp.journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/2021/TPDP2021CfP.pdf) for [TPDP 2021](https://tpdp.journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/2021/), which will be a workshop affiliated with [ICML 2021](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2021/).
The submission deadline is Friday, May 28, 2021 (conveniently, two days after the deadline for NeurIPS 2021).
Submissions are extended abstracts of up to four pages in length, and will undergo a lightweight review process, based mostly on relevance and interest to the differential privacy community.
The workshop is non-archival, so feel free to submit recent work at any stage of publication.
One goal of the workshop is to be inclusive and welcoming to newcomers to the differential privacy community, so please consider participating even if you are new to the field.

Most papers will be presented as posters at a (virtual) poster session, while a few papers will be selected for spotlight talks.
There will also be plenary talks by [Katrina Ligett](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~katrina/) (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) and [Ryan Rogers](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ryrogers/) (LinkedIn).
The program co-chairs are [Rachel Cummings](https://sites.gatech.edu/rachel-cummings/) and [myself](http://www.gautamkamath.com/).
Please submit your best work on differential privacy, and hope to see you there!
