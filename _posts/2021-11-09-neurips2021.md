The accepted papers for [NeurIPS 2021](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020) were recently announced, and there's a huge amount of differential privacy content. 
We found one relevant workshop and 48 papers.
This is up from 31 papers last year, an over 50% increase!
It looks like there's huge growth in interest on differentially private machine learning.
Impressively, at the time of this writing, all but five papers are already posted on arXiv!
For the full list of accepted papers, see [here](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/AcceptedPapersInitial).
Please let us know if we missed relevant papers on differential privacy!
