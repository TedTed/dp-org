[STOC 2020](http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2020/) was recently held online, as one of the first major theory conferences during the COVID-19 era.
It featured four papers on differential privacy, which we list and link below.
Each one is accompanied by a video from the conference, as well as a longer video if available.
Please let us know if we missed any papers on differential privacy, either in the comments below or by email.
